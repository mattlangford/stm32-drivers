## STM32 Drivers

This repo exists to act as a lightweight wrapper around the actual drivers from the
[STM32CubeF7](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF7) repo. This also includes some bazel nice-to-haves that
are trickier to implement in the base repo. I've copied a lot of the files I need, and left out others.
